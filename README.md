![trade images](assets/trade.jpg))

## 🧠 Context

As a newly hired junior trader on the mortgage trading desk of a lending firm, you're responsible for managing the flow of capital from institutional investors to individual borrowers. This simulation reflects the real-world dynamics of the **mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** market, where identifying and evaluating trade opportunities is critical to maintaining profitability and risk control.

In this case study, you're tasked with analyzing a portfolio of mortgage loans, assessing bids from investors, and executing trades that balance revenue with risk exposure.

## ✅ Solution

Using **Power BI**, this project includes:

- **Data integration** and transformation of mortgage datasets using Power Query
- **Data modeling** to structure loan, bid, and trading information effectively
- Development of **DAX measures** to evaluate loan quality, bid performance, and profitability
- Building **interactive dashboards** to:
  - Segment and filter mortgages
  - Compare investor bids
  - Identify optimal trades

The report simulates the trading decision-making process and provides an interface to evaluate performance in real time.

## 📈 Result

- Developed a mortgage trading dashboard that enables:
  - Selection of mortgage populations based on key attributes (e.g., interest rate, term, risk level)
  - Evaluation of incoming bids from investors
  - Execution of trades based on data-driven insights

- Improved understanding of:
  - Capital flow from investment banks to consumers
  - Mortgage trading mechanics and risk management
  - Financial analysis using Power BI

- Strengthened practical skills in **data modeling**, **DAX**, and **financial analytics** within a real-world context

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Power BI Desktop  
- Power Query Editor  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
